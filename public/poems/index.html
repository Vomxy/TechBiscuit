                <span class="poem-line">he made her soft pavilions</span>
                
                <span class="poem-line">of lilies, and a bridal bed</span>
                
                <span class="poem-line">of flowers and of thistle-down</span>

                <span class="poem-line">and fell to bitter quarrelling;</span>

                <span class="poem-line">as shivering he fled away;</span>

                <span class="poem-line">his sword that shone like a sun.</span>
                
                <span class="poem-line">He passed the archipelagoes</span>

                <span class="poem-line">with masts of gold and silver boughs</span>

                <span class="poem-line">And looked down one as far as I could</span>
