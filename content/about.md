## Welcome to TheTechBiscuit

TheTechBiscuit is a personal blog by Zack Baxter, exploring the intersection of technology, privacy, and security. This site is a space for long-form writing, honest opinions, and practical knowledge — free from algorithms, trackers, and the noise of social media.

## What You'll Find Here

The writing here covers topics like information security, digital sovereignty, privacy-respecting software, and the occasional deep dive into whatever rabbit hole catches my attention. Whether it's examining the tools we use every day or questioning the systems behind them, the goal is always the same: think critically, share openly, and learn along the way.

## Why This Site Exists

I built TheTechBiscuit because I wanted a corner of the internet that's truly mine — a place to develop ideas beyond the character limits and short attention spans that social platforms encourage. Writing here helps me think more clearly, and if something I share helps someone else along the way, even better.
