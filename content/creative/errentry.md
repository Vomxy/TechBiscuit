lines:
  - "There was a merry passenger,"
  - "a messenger, a mariner:"
  - "he built a gilded gondola"
  - "to wander in and had in her"
  - "a load of yellow oranges"
  - "and porridge for his provender;"
  - "he perfumed her with marjoram,"
  - "and cardamom and lavender."
  - ""
  - "He called the winds of argosies"
  - "with cargoes in to carry him"
  - "across the rivers seventeen"
  - "that lay between to tarry him."
  - "He landed all in loneliness"
  - "where stonily the pebbles on"
  - "the running river Derrilyn"
  - "goes merrily for ever on."
  - ""
  - "He journeyed then through meadow-lands"
  - "to Shadow-land that dreary lay,"
  - "and under hill and over hill"
  - "went roving still a weary way."
  - ""
  - "He sat and sang a melody,"
  - "his errantry a-tarrying;"
  - "he begged a pretty butterfly"
  - "that fluttered by to marry him."
  - "She scorned him and she scoffed at him,"
  - "she laughed at him unpitying;"
  - "so long he studied wizardry,"
  - "and sigaldry and smithying."
  - ""
  - "He wove a tissue airy-thin"
  - "to snare her in; to follow her"
  - "he made him beetle-leather-wing,"
  - "and feather wing of swallow hair."
  - "He caught her in bewilderment"
  - "with filament of spider-thread;"
  - "he made her soft pavilions"
  - "of lilies, and a bridal bed"
  - "of flowers and of thistle-down"
  - "to nestle down and rest her in;"
  - "and silken webs of filmy white"
  - "and silver light he dressed her in."
  - ""
  - "He threaded gems and necklaces,"
  - "but recklessly she squandered them,"
  - "and fell to bitter quarrelling;"
  - "then sorrowing he wandered on,"
  - "and there he left her withering,"
  - "as shivering he fled away;"
  - "with windy weather following,"
  - "on swallow-wing he sped away."
  - ""
  - "He made a shield and morion"
  - "of coral and carnelian,"
  - "and silvered was the handle of"
  - "his sword that shone like a sun."
  - "He passed the archipelagoes"
  - "where yellow quays and harbour crowd"
  - "with masts of gold and silver boughs"
  - "and pavements bright as mirrors proud."
  - ""
  - "He battled with the Balrog's breed"
  - "and harried dragon's hoarded gold,"
  - "and all the goblins of the hills"
  - "he drove into their dens of old."
  - ""
  - "He made a song for every star,"
  - "a song for every season fair,"
  - "and wandered wide o'er land and sea"
  - "with never end to his affair."
  - ""
  - "He sought the sun in summer time"
  - "and followed moon through winter cold,"
  - "and watched the stars in their courses"
  - "and the clouds in their manifold."
  - ""
  - "He danced among the daisies"
  - "and the daffodils in spring,"
  - "and he blew on his silver bugle"
  - "till the woods with echoes ring."
  - ""
  - "He wandered up the mountain's side"
  - "where shadows never fall"
  - "and he found a crystal fountain"
  - "and he drank from it his fill."
  - ""
  - "He sang of battles, long and loud,"
  - "of love, of loss, of laughter,"
  - "and made a harp of holly-wood"
  - "to play for ever after."
