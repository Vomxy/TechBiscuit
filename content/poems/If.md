title: "If—"
author: "Rudyard Kipling"
lines:
  - "If you can keep your head when all about you"
  - "Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;"
  - "If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,"
  - "But make allowance for their doubting too;"
  - ""
  - "If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,"
  - "Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,"
  - "Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,"
  - "And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;"
  - ""
  - "If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;"
  - "If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;"
  - "If you can meet with triumph and disaster"
  - "And treat those two impostors just the same;"
  - ""
  - "If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken"
  - "Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,"
  - "Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,"
  - "And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools;"
  - ""
  - "If you can fill the unforgiving minute"
  - "With sixty seconds' worth of distance run—"
  - "Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,"
  - "And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!"
