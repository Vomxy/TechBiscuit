Last night, I opened X–a distraction from what I should have been doing. Charlie Kirk's name was trending, and I shrugged it off, assuming it was an announcement, a popular clip, or a passionate debate about any number of topics. The first post on my feed stated that Charlie had been shot! No part of me believed it had really happened, and even if it had, I knew he was in safe hands. With every scroll, my silence deafened me. After searching for news for nine minutes, it was announced that the shot had killed him. In the aftermath of his death, everyone, everywhere, felt the tragedy of losing a good man.

Charlie Kirk was a man who embodied his values in both public and private life. He exemplified what it means to be an American. He understood the value of freedom of speech, and through every conversation, he reminded us of its purpose. He was courageous beyond description and Christian to his core. Through his nature and now his departure, the color of every soul is laid bare. The cowardice visible in the hearts of some has come from the same hearts that he had the strength and love to forgive.

In the search for truth, it is not our right but our responsibility to speak freely; not despite but in spite of our disagreements, we will find the path. It is the realization by people of all nations that what he was doing was what we all should have been striving to do. This is not just a loss for America or conservatives, but a punch to the throat for everyone who has witnessed or paid the price for our freedom.
It’s clear that this is not the end of Charlie Kirk but the start of a million more.

Because of Charlie Kirk, millions are attending church and dusting off their Bibles. High schools and universities are filled with boys and men dressed in suits. Millions know the face of cowardice, and everybody knows what a good man looks like.

In the aftermath of his death, everyone, everywhere, felt the tragedy of losing a Good man.
