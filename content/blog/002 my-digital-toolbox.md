## Introduction
The software and tools we dictate what we are able to do with our computers; the same machine can be a solitaire champion, or a movie making powerhouse. We think about these tools by their purpose, it’s intuitiveness, and how they do what they do. Some tools share the same purpose, they do the exact same thing for us, but one makes it easier to use than the other, so we use that. Some apps make it easy to use, but we don’t like how they do it.

## What Do I Look For in Tools
When I am looking at any given tool, im thinking about:
 1) Reputable?
	 - What are the values of the developers?
	 - Does this tool reduce or increase my attack surface?
 2) Effective?
	 - Will it do its job?
	 - Is it better than what I’m currently doing?
 3) Learning Curve?
	 - How much time will it take to learn to use?
	 - Is it easy to learn?



For the pillars that the tools we use are built to serve, here are the ones I believe are worth their weight in gold, and I hope will stand the test of time.
