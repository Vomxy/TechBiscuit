            <section class="content">
                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>TechBiscuit is the amalgamation of numerous projects I’ve built over the years—each one a stepping stone towards something greater. Every project started with the goal of being unique, a fresh idea different from the last. Yet, they often fell apart, either because I was too eager to start the next big thing or because my enthusiasm waned. Despite this, I preserved the code, knowing that these spare parts, would eventually be the parts I needed to build my great Frankenstein's monster.</p>
                <p>TechBiscuit is that creation. It might not be the most extravagant site on the web, but it’s mine, and it does exactly what it’s meant to do. I encourage you to explore it—you might find it more interesting than you expect.</p>

                <h2 id="journey">The Journey to TechBiscuit</h2>
                <p>I’ve built several websites, each intended to be a personal blog and a platform to share my thoughts. The journey began with HackBabble—or, more accurately, it started even earlier with my first WordPress site and a YouTube channel where I dreamt of becoming a great content creator. HackBabble was where I published articles comparing different file systems and examining the distinctions between Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. It was the first site that felt truly mine, even though it was inspired by the code from websites I admired. I built a brand by creating Instagram accounts and posts that condensed my articles into bite-sized, informative pieces. Researching for HackBabble led me down some of the most fascinating rabbit holes in information security—one of my favorites being Google dorking, a technique I believe everyone should learn.</p>
                <p>The second iteration of HackBabble evolved into the first version of TechBiscuit (techbiscuit.co). This site featured a darker aesthetic with a striking purple accent. It was intended to be the front desk to a grand hotel of open-source software, a collaborative enterprise between my friend and me. Unfortunately, while our ambition was high, our work ethic didn’t sustain after the website was built.</p>
                <p>My third website took some of the styling from its predecessor and laid the foundation for what TechBiscuit would become. This site was themed around the classic hangman game but had a much deeper purpose—it was a platform for internet theories and conspiracies, designed to foster research and critical thinking. Users could submit their theories, which would undergo a vetting process before being published alongside any supporting evidence. Others could then add their own evidence, critique the theories, and engage in thoughtful discussions.</p>
                <p>Finally, we arrive at the current iteration of TechBiscuit—a blend of all my previous projects yet something entirely new. I initially wanted to return to the techbiscuit.co domain because it had a nice ring to it, but there were a few issues:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> .co domains are often more expensive, and I wanted this site to be a long-term project, while .com was more affordable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> A .com domain lends more legitimacy and recognition to a site.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>And so, I chose thetechbiscuit.com.</p>

                <h2 id="why-personal-website">Why I Needed a Personal Website</h2>
                <p>Over the past four years, I’ve created, archived, reopened, and deleted accounts on every social media platform imaginable, again and again. Having an online presence has become essential for anyone seeking legitimacy—whether it’s to meet new people, provide a place for others to learn more about you, or stay updated with your social circle.</p>
                <p>But with social media comes code you can’t fully understand, and even if you did, the platforms would do everything to keep it hidden. As someone who values privacy, especially with the amount of data these platforms collect—like which posts catch your eye, the metadata in your photos, or the list of people you know—this concerns me deeply. A part of me firmly believes privacy needs to be prioritised above all its benefits, because once it’s lost, you can never return to the sense of absolute privacy you once had.</p>
                <p>I also needed a personal website to help me develop my ability to express thoughts in a structured and meaningful way. For the past few years, the confidence in my ability to write and think has been tapering, and largely due to the brevity encouraged by text messaging, comment sections and short-form posts being the only available way to communicate on social platforms. The platforms condition us to think in snippets, which doesn’t translate well into deep conversations. By writing more, I aim to create an archive of well-considered thoughts—ideas that I’ve taken the time to explore and critique before sharing publicly. This ensures that what I post isn’t just a fleeting remark, but something I truly believe and stand behind.</p>
                <p>Of course, my thoughts and feelings will evolve. I’m human, and I expect to make mistakes, hold incorrect views, and sometimes fail to communicate my ideas as clearly as I’d like. But I’m committed to learning from these experiences. I welcome criticism because it’s essential for growth.</p>
                <p>At the heart of it, I simply have things I want to share. Thoughts and ideas often cycle through my mind, and I find peace in knowing that once I’ve shared them—once I’ve seen that they’ve made a difference to someone else—that mental circuit can finally rest.</p>
