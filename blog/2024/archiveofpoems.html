            <p class="poem-author">by Robert Frost</p>
            <div class="poem-text">
                <span class="poem-line">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And sorry I could not travel both</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And be one traveler, long I stood</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And looked down one as far as I could</span>
                <span class="poem-line">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Then took the other, as just as fair,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And having perhaps the better claim,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Though as for that the passing there</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Had worn them really about the same,</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">And both that morning equally lay</span>
                <span class="poem-line">In leaves no step had trodden black.</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Oh, I kept the first for another day!</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I doubted if I should ever come back.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">I shall be telling this with a sigh</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Somewhere ages and ages hence:</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I took the one less traveled by,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And that has made all the difference.</span>

            <div class="poem-text">
                <span class="poem-line">Out of the night that covers me,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Black as the pit from pole to pole,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I thank whatever gods may be</span>
                <span class="poem-line">For my unconquerable soul.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">In the fell clutch of circumstance</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I have not winced nor cried aloud.</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Under the bludgeonings of chance</span>
                <span class="poem-line">My head is bloody, but unbowed.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Beyond this place of wrath and tears</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Looms but the Horror of the shade,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And yet the menace of the years</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">It matters not how strait the gate,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">How charged with punishments the scroll,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I am the master of my fate:</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I am the captain of my soul.</span>

              <p class="poem-author">by Maya Angelou</p>
              <div class="poem-text">
                <span class="poem-line">You may write me down in history</span>
                <span class="poem-line">With your bitter, twisted lies,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">You may trod me in the very dirt</span>
                <span class="poem-line">But still, like dust, I'll rise.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Does my sassiness upset you?</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Why are you beset with gloom?</span>
                <span class="poem-line">'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Pumping in my living room.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Just like moons and like suns,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">With the certainty of tides,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Just like hopes springing high,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Still I'll rise.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Did you want to see me broken?</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Bowed head and lowered eyes?</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Shoulders falling down like teardrops,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Weakened by my soulful cries?</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Does my haughtiness offend you?</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Don't you take it awful hard</span>
                <span class="poem-line">'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Diggin' in my own backyard.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">You may shoot me with your words,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">You may cut me with your eyes,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">You may kill me with your hatefulness,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">But still, like air, I'll rise.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Does my sexiness upset you?</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Does it come as a surprise</span>
                <span class="poem-line">That I dance like I've got diamonds</span>
                <span class="poem-line">At the meeting of my thighs?</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Out of the huts of history's shame</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I rise</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Up from a past that's rooted in pain</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I rise</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Leaving behind nights of terror and fear</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I rise</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I rise</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I am the dream and the hope of the slave.</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I rise</span>
                <span class="poem-line">I rise</span>

                <span class="poem-line">If you can keep your head when all about you</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;</span>
                <span class="poem-line">If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">But make allowance for their doubting too;</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;</span>

                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools;</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">If you can make one heap of all your winnings</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And lose, and start again at your beginnings,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And never breathe a word about your loss;</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</span>
                <span class="poem-line">To serve your turn long after they are gone,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And so hold on when there is nothing in you</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on;"</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;</span>
                <span class="poem-line">If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;</span>
                <span class="poem-line">If all men count with you, but none too much;</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">If you can fill the unforgiving minute</span>
                <span class="poem-line">With sixty seconds' worth of distance run—</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,</span>

                <span class="poem-line">Figure it out for yourself, my lad,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">You've all that the greatest of men have had,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Two arms, two hands, two legs, two eyes,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And a brain to use if you would be wise.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">With this equipment they all began,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">So start for the top and say “I can.”</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Look them over, the wise and great,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">They take their food from a common plate</span>
                <span class="poem-line">And similar knives and forks they use,</span>

                <span class="poem-line">The world considers them brave and smart.</span>

                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">And the man who has risen, great deeds to do</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Began his life with no more than you.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">You are the handicap you must face,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">You are the one who must choose your place,</span>

                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">God has equipped you for life, my son,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">With His own great gifts, and He’s only one</span>
                <span class="poem-line">To know what is best for you, you’ll find,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">So you must use your gifts with the wise in mind.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="poem-line">Use the brains you have, use the legs you’ve got,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">Use the hands you have; if you will not,</span>
                <span class="poem-line">You will never get anywhere, my friend,</span>
